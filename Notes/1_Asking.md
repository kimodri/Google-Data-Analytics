## Objective
There is a great quote usually attributed to Albert Einstein that says:
>Given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes understanding the problem and one minute resolving it.

That may be an exaggeration but it's something to think of whenever you feel like you are not making a progress simply by not digging immediately in the analysis.
- Finishing this course, one must be able to use techniques to effectively ask questions to define the problem

## Asking Steps
1. Define the problem
2. Identify the type of problem
3. Asking the right questions to guide your analysis
4. Use structured thinking to start

## Recall
Google course on data analytics:
There are **6 phases** for data analysis and this 6 phases are the coverage for this program and these are

| **Step**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Asking**       | Communicate with stakeholders about the problem to be solved. Ask relevant questions to narrow the focus of analysis. <br><br>**Example**: What are the possible data? What is the root problem/cause? |
| **Preparation**  | Gather the data to analyze. It could be through surveys or past company data.                                                                                   |
| **Process**      | Manipulate the gathered data, such as removing outliers or filling nulls.                                                                                       |
| **Analyzing**    | Analyze the cleaned data to find patterns, if any.                                                                                                              |
| **Sharing**      | Share the findings using visualizations.                                                                                                                        |
| **Act**          | Recommend proper steps for the company to solve the problem based on the analysis.                                                                              |

## Steps in Depth
### 1. Defining the problem
- A defined problem means you fully understand what the stakeholders want you to do (It is you getting a grasp of the problem)

**In this step you can ask questions or do things such as:**
- What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
- Now that I have identified the issues, how can I help to solve the problem?
- Directly ask the stakeholders what they want/need.

To have a grasp of the problem you can go to the root cause with the **"5 Whys"**

    The 5 Whys technique is a problem-solving method that involves asking "Why?" five times to identify the root cause of an issue:

    - State the problem clearly
    - As "why" five times
    - Use the answer to the previous question as the basis for each new questionion

Example:

| **Problem**                     | **There is a puddle of water on the floor.** |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Why?**                        | The overhead pipe is leaking.                |
| **Why?**                        | There is too much water pressure in the pipe.|
| **Why?**                        | There is a faulty control valve.             |
| **Why?**                        | Control valves have not been tested.         |
| **Why?**                        | Control valves are not on the maintenance schedule. |

### 2. Identify the Type of Problem
- After defining the problem we should now identify where the problem falls because doing so can lead you to the proper steps in solving it.<br>

**There are 6 common problems:**

|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Making predictions**     | Using data to forecast events.                                                                                  | Hospitals may use the vital signs of a patient from a smartwatch to predict their condition.                    |
| **Categorizing things**     | Grouping data based on similar features.                                                                       | Grouping employees based on their tasks, such as engineering or sales.                                          |
| **Spotting something unusual** | Identifying anomalies in data that indicate something unexpected.                                               | A school notices a spike in enrollment and finds in the data that a new condominium has been built nearby.       |
| **Identifying themes**      | Grouping with broader concepts to uncover overarching ideas.                                                   | Instead of just grouping employees by tasks, find themes like productivity among those groups.                  |
| **Discovering connections** | Finding similar challenges among different entities and collaborating to solve the problem.                    | If a company experiences delays in shipments, the issue might be traced to a logistics partner or their partner. |
| **Finding patterns**        | Using historical data to predict or explore trends.                                                            | Analyzing spending trends in e-commerce to predict future investment opportunities.                              |

### 3. Asking the right questions about the problem
- With the problem defined, you can still ask questions. These questions will guide you to solve the problem you have defined from step 1 (This can also help you guide you throughout your analysis).



To ask the right question you should employ the **SMART** method of asking.
| **SMART**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    | **Not a Good Example**                                                                                  | **A Good Example**                                                                                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Specific**      | Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or related ideas to collect relevant information.                                                              | Are kids getting enough physical activities these days?                                                | What percentage of kids achieve the recommended 60 minutes of physical activity at least five days a week?         |
| **Measurable**    | Questions can be quantified and assessed to provide concrete answers.                                                                                                           | Why did a recent video go viral?                                                                       | How many times was our video shared on social channels the first week it was posted?                                |
| **Action-Oriented** | Questions encourage actionable change by identifying steps to move toward the ideal state.                                                                                     | How can we get customers to recycle our product packaging?                                             | What design features will make our packaging easier to recycle?                                                    |
| **Relevant**      | Questions matter and are significant to the problem being addressed.                                                                                                            | Why does it matter that Pine Barrens tree frogs started disappearing?                                  | What environmental factors changed in Durham, NC, between 1983 and 2004 that could cause the frogs to disappear?   |
| **Time-Bound**    | Questions specify the time period to focus on relevant data and limit the range of possibilities.                                                                                | How did the disappearance of frogs impact ecosystems?                                                 | What environmental factors changed in Durham, NC, between 1983 and 2004 that could cause Pine Barrens tree frogs to disappear? |

### 4. Use structured thinking to start
- After asking a bunch of question what to do next? You're next step to know how you will solve the problem (What should your output be? What is the scope of your work?)

But what is the best way to work on your tasks?
>The best way is using structured thinking.

To understand **structured thinking**, one must learn what problem domain is.

- **Problem domain** is the specific area or topic you’re investigating. It sets boundaries for your work and ensures you’re focused.

**Example:**
    
- If your task is to analyze customer satisfaction for a retail store:
- The problem domain is customer satisfaction (not store profitability or inventory management).
- You’ll focus only on surveys, reviews, and feedback related to satisfaction.

**Structured thinking**
- It is having a clear list of what you are expected to deliver, timeline of the tasks
- Why we do it? To identify which parts deserve more attention etc.
- The starting place of structured thinking is identifying **problem domain**. **Once you know the specific area of analysis, you can set your base and lay out all your requirements and hypotheses before you start investigating**.

To practice Structured thinking one can do a _**Scope of Work**_ that is an agreed upon outline of the work you're going to do to perform on a project. It's like a Gantt chart.

A Scope of Work (SOW) is a detailed outline of a project. It includes:
| **Component**   | **Description**                                  | **Example in wedding**                                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deliverables** | What you’ll produce (e.g., reports, visuals).    | Design, print, and mail invitations.                      |
| **Timeline**     | Deadlines for tasks and milestones.              | Approve design by Jan 12, mail by Feb 1.                  |
| **Milestones**   | Key checkpoints for progress tracking.           | Finalize guest list by Jan 10.                            |
| **Reports**      | Regular updates to ensure alignment.             | Weekly updates to track progress.                         |

**A scope of work of an analyst may be:**
- Processing
- Analyzing
- Visualization

## Additional Readings
### Metrics
This is not a part of the steps in the Asking phase, however metrics is one of the things that an analyst must keep in mind alongside the questions for this could be a thing where our analysis might revolve.


>What are materics and how does it relate to data analysis?

**Metrics**. In my understanding this could be the measurement where we as analyst sometimes revolve our analysis. For example, a metrics can be a revenue. From this metrics we can do our analysis by answering if the data handed to us satisfied that metrics. Nevertheless, metrics is one of the things that an analyst must consider before diving into the analysis.
